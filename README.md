# Project overview

## Project Abstract
This document proposes a social photo and video sharing application that keeps things much more casual in the media space. In the current environment, an unhealthy attachment has grown for many when it comes to their self-esteem, with the use of likes, comments, and views aiding many in validation of themselves. With Keeping It Casual (KIC), users are able to create accounts, post content, and follow others without a dependency developing and instead can focus on the simple enjoyment of a profile curated by them, a feed of their friends, and photos/videos posted without fear of judgement. For this application, there will be a simple three pages for a user to choose from, either being their feed, which consists of their following content, their own profile, which consists of their content, or the posting platform, which is where they will be able to add posts to their profile.

## High Level Requirement
This project is a sharing platform very similar to Instagram, Vine, TikTok, etc, but without the same pressures of likes, comments, and shares. Users will be able to post content, follow others, and see the combination of photos and videos that their following and selves post, but interaction with these posts is not an ability KIC gives due to its proven effect on the mentality of users of other popular applications.

## Conceptual Design
For the front-end of this application, we would be using React Native, a language that allows for compatibility with both iOS and Android systems. This aids in creating a UI focused mobile application, with any individuals with knowledge of JavaScript being able to pick up the language quickly. As for the back-end, we can potentially use Python (Django) and HTML, with a database through PostgreSQL. This will depend on the teamâ€™s experience, but these are similar to the frameworks that popular applications use. We will also need a deployment service to host our application.

## Background
This app is inspired by popular platforms that have similar functionalities, like content sharing, profile building, and the following feature. Most closely this app will be competing with Instagram, but unlike Instagram it will not have a lot of the same negative impacts on the individual, such as anxiety, depression, bullying, negative body image, and poor sleep habits (Abington Health). Instead, it will thrive on allowing users to share content that is casual, personal, and not curated to fit the Instagram mold. It eliminates the ability for influencers, and will encourage users to not over-edit or perfect their photos.

## Required Resources
An IDE for development in React Native
An IDE for development in Python (specifically Django) and HTML
PostgreSQL
Deployment service
